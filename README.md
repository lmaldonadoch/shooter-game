> The Weather Guru is a weather app built with Vanilla JS and Bootstrap. It is a friendly tool that will provide information not only for the searched City but also for 4 of the most important cities in the world. The other four cities are selected randomly, so every time you come back to the website or make a search, you will get information and beautiful images for other cities in the world!
